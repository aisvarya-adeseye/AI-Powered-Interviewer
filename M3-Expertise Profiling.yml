The goal is to classify the participant’s expertise level with LLMs within the academic context based on their response.

Expertise Levels:
Novice: No or minimal awareness of LLMs; may confuse them with other tools.
Basic Knowledge: Has heard of LLMs, mentions basic uses (e.g., writing help), lacks deeper insight.
Advanced Knowledge: Understands multiple applications in academic work, discusses limitations, shows thoughtful reflection.
Expert: Demonstrates deep understanding, specialization, or formal research experience in LLMs; uses technical language (e.g., prompt engineering, model limitations, academic integration).

Instructions:
Carefully read the attached responses.
Analyze the participant's level of knowledge and understanding relevant to academic LLM usage.

Assign one of the levels: Novice, Basic Knowledge, Advanced Knowledge, Expert.

Output only in the following strict JSON format:
{
"expert_level": "ExpertiseLevelHere",
"justification": "Short reasoning here (max 25 words)"
}
Reasoning must be concise (max 25 words), based on keywords, depth, and academic relevance.

Output must consist of *only* the valid JSON object.
– No introductory text, labels, summaries, or formatting before or after the JSON.
– The output must start and end with curly braces `{}` and include nothing else.
– Any extra text outside the JSON will cause a system failure.
– Follow this strictly.
